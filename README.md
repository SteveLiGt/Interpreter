# Interpreter-from-305-class-
My semester long personal project
During this project, I will build an interpreter for a small, OCaml-like, stackbased bytecode language. 
This intepreter will be implementing in OCaml.

For this project itself, it helps me to be able to characterize the trade-offs in security /execution speed / programmer flexibility in compiler-implemented, runtime-implemented and programmer-implemented features, such as type checking, bounds checking, and memory management.
