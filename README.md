# Interpreter-from-305-class-
My semester long personal project
During this project, I built an interpreter for a small, OCaml-like, stackbased bytecode language. 
<br>
This intepreter are implemented in OCaml.
During this project, I leanred to characterized the trade-offs in security, execution speed, and programmer flexibility in compiler-implemented, runtime-implemented,
and programmer-implemented features such as type checking, bounds checking, and memory management.


Within the project, 
it will be able to handle function call with variables by parsing commands from file 
1. add, sub, mul, div, rem, neg for interger operations
2. push, pop, swap for stackvalue operation
3. tostring, println , cat for print or write into file
4. and, or, not, equal, lessthen for boolean operation
5. let, end, fun, funend, return, call for function operation
6. bind for variable assignments. 
7. quit for quit interterpreter.
